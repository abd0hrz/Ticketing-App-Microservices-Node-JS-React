# Ticketing_App_Microservices_Node_JS_React
E-Commerce app using Microservices built with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes

## What Technology I Used

I built a full stack application, I used a variety of technologies. On the frontend, I used React and Next JS to present content to users. Each service is created using Node and Express. Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database or Redis. The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this app is written with Typescript.
