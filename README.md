# Ticketing_App_Microservices_Node_JS_React
E-Commerce app using Microservices built with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes

## What Technology I Used

I'm building a full stack application, I will use a variety of technologies. On the frontend, I'll use React and Next JS to present content to users. Each service is created using Node and Express. Data for each service is held in either a Mongo database or Redis. The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this app is written with Typescript.
